    "question": "What’s a hackathon?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Hackathons are overnight events in which creative folks take on challenges from education to technology by building out an idea.",
      "long": "The overnighter is a productivity legend. With a looming deadline and weeks of procrastination behind you, something needs to be finished by tomorrow. You summon the strength of Gods to pull it off in a matter of hours. Bottle that miracle and put it in the context of a challenge posed by a company or a project you’ve always wanted to work on. That’s a hackathon."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can participate?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Everyone",
      "long": "Most of our events are long so we don’t recommend signing up to participate unless you can make the commitment for the team you are on; you’re welcome to grab a ticket just to check it out. We welcome the type of person that is curious, is ready to make mistakes and likes to solve problems because it’s fun."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I have to know how to code? What skills am I expected to have?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "No coding necessary but you should be open to learning new skills to solve problems. Being at a MonkeyBars hackathon is skill agnostic but is culture specific.",
      "long": "Coding is only one tool that you can use for solving problems. The best projects we’ve seen have come from the most talent diverse teams, teams who decided to take on a challenge that required them to learn a new skill set or merge disciplinary approaches. Expected Skills: Willingness to fail and get back up, passion for creation and an unquenchable desire to learn."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "What does MonkeyBars do again?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "We create and use hackathons to help people/organizations learn and solve problems.",
      "long": "Hackathons are a learning and problem solving tool. For example, learning new tools happens naturally when you spend time working on an idea you care about; you can make a lot of progress on a problem when you put yourself in a focused, collaborative environment; and you naturally form a bond with people when you share an intense experience. MonkeyBars uses these understanding to empower students (of all ages) and to help organizations grow."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Why 'MonkeyBars'?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Just because.",
      "long": "The playground is a place to have fun, make mistakes and meet friends. That is what we want our events to embody. Outside of that…it just sounded good at the time."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Do Hackathons actually produce anything worthwhile?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "They work very well for connecting people, sharing ideas, building prototypes and learning new skills in a short period of time. They do not work well for building a full scale product or business.",
      "long": "Hackathons, like any good tool, have a few great use cases and plenty of poor ones. Getting a large group of people together for a cause has natural social benefits but, as we’ve seen with political movements, it takes a well thought out strategy to create meaningful, tangible outcomes. Many groups misuse hackathons leaving hackathon goers and companies a like disenchanted. Our goal is to bring a purposeful approach to hackathons and focus on the value for those in attendance."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Aren’t hackathons like slavery?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Not if you do it right.",
      "long": "They can certainly feel like bad sometimes. Some corporate run hackathons make participants feel used by presenting self serving challenges with little concern for the participant outside of their ability to compete. This sucks but not all hackathons are like that. The best hackathons don’t feel like a competition; they foster a sense of community and shared accomplishment."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should I participate?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Why not?",
      "long": "To learn new skills. To meet other doers/makers/creators. To connect with pros in industry. To try out an idea. To play with gadgets. To win cool stuff."
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "How old do you have to be to participate?",
    "answers": {
      "short": "Depends...",
      "long": "There is technically no age limit since you can work on whatever you’d like at whatever pace you feel comfortable. However; if you’re a minor, we need consent from a parent or legal guardian for you to stay overnight."
