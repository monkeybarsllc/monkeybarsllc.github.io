  "story": "MonkeyBars and Hack@UChicago proudly present to you, The Forge. We believe that the best products come from a focus on idea development and iteration, not business models and business plans. This fall, we will pay homage to this belief by inviting Chicago university students to a 28 hour ideation and rapid prototyping competition complete with hot new technology, like the Leap motion as well as hot old technology, like 3D printers and milling machines. See you there!",
