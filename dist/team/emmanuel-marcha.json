  "story": "Hi there! I’m Manny and I really hate writing personal bios. There’s nothing more annoying than having to list my accomplishments in a superfluous (yet subtle) way. Unfortunately, the rest of the MonkeyBars team has threatened to eat my kidneys unless I complete this, so… I write code. All day (except for the occasional Netflix binge). I built this website. I’ve built other websites and web apps. If you’re really curious, Google me. I come up as 67% of the results (ignore the YouTube one, please). I’m one of the original founders of MonkeyBars because I met Taylor in college. It sounded like a good idea then, and here we are now. If you feel like talking, send me an email or DM. I’m sure Google has either of those publicly listed. Oh! Right - [Insert playground metaphor here]"
