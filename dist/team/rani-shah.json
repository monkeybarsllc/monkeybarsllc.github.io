  "story": "You could say MonkeyBars found me. I’m always looking to work with and meet people who not only encourage ‘thinking outside the box’ but completely ‘redesigning the shape of the box’. I was Student Body President at the Illinois Institute of Technology and was constantly immersed by technology and opportunities to rally people around super cool causes, everything from the US financial crisis to open forums with administration; that being said, my transition to MonkeyBars was a no-brainer. You’ll find me on the swings at the playground, trying to reach the sky."
