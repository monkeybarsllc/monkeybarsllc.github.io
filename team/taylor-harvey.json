  "story": "Howdy! Iâ€™m one of the original Monkeys on the team and my vision from the beginning has been to discover how hackathons could improve the way people, especially students, learn new skills and discover their passions. Before I got into MonkeyBars I co-founded a scholarship for undergraduates, dabbled in stock trading and failed at a grocery app startup. If you catch me on the playground you can find me on the jungle gym."
